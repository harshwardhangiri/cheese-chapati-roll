take a plate keep your chapati on it and spread LITTLE amount of  pickle  on the chapati then spread some tomato and add the sliced cheese then roll it and keep it inside the oven until the the cheese melts .

and this is my way  and i like this  recipe  very much and it can also taste bad to you itis all about diffrent opinions. but trust me it is very good and easy.

                  Thankyou
